# current situation
Code should work out of the box if you have installed all the requirements.

No. I have published a requirements.txt file.


Q: Where is this file?

A: https://github.com/pleabargain/copilot_course

```py manage.py makemigrations```

I spent a lot of time here trying to figure out the terminal errors. :( 


```py manage.py migrate```

```py manage.py createsuperuser```

```py manage.py runserver```

If you are lucky you will get a URL. http://127.0.0.1:8000/

YMMV!

Can't say that I am super happy. The results in the class are NOT what I'm getting locally. The instructor, Ronnie Sheer (https://www.linkedin.com/learning/instructors/ronnie-sheer) didn't provide the source code for the working examples in the course.
